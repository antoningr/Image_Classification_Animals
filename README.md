# 🧠 Vision Transformer (ViT) Image Classifier

This project demonstrates how to use a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) model from Hugging Face Transformers to classify animal images using a dataset downloaded from Kaggle via `kagglehub`.

---

## 📂 Dataset

We use the [Animal Image Dataset (90 categories)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals), which contains labeled images of 90 different animals. The dataset is automatically downloaded using `kagglehub`.

---

## 🚀 What This Notebook Does

- Downloads and loads the animal image dataset
- Uses the `google/vit-base-patch16-224` model from Hugging Face
- Classifies up to 10 images using ImageNet labels
- Displays images with the predicted class

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

Install the necessary libraries:

```bash
pip install transformers torch Pillow kagglehub
⚠️ Note: If using Google Colab, just run the notebook—no local setup needed.

📘 Usage
python
Copy
Edit
# Download the dataset using kagglehub
import kagglehub
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("iamsouravbanerjee/animal-image-dataset-90-different-animals")

# Then run predictions using ViT
See the vit_classifier_colab.ipynb notebook for full code.

🧠 Model Used
google/vit-base-patch16-224
Pretrained Vision Transformer model, fine-tuned on ImageNet-1k.
